# # Simultaneous multi-objective multi-fidelity optimization  

# In this tutorial notebook we demonstrate how to perform multi-objective multi-fidelity (MOMF) optimization in BoTORCH as described in [1]. The main concept in MOMF is introducing a 'fidelity objective' that is optimized along with the problem objectives. This fidelity objective can be thought of as a trust objective that rewards the optimization when going to higher fidelity. This emulates a real world scenario where high fidelity data may sometime yield similar values for other objectives but is still considered more trustworthy. Thus the MOMF explicitly optimizes for getting more trustworthy data while taking into account the higher computational costs associated with it.
# 
# We will optimize a synthetic function that is a modified multi-fidelity Branin-Currin. This is a 3 x 2 dimensional problem with one of the input dimension being the fidelity. For the MOMF this results in a 3 x 3 optimization since it also takes into account the fidelity objective. In this case the fidelity objective is taken to be a linear function of fidelity, $ f(s)=s$, where $s$ is the fidelity. The MOMF algorithm can accept any discrete or continuous cost functions as an input. In this example, we choose an exponential dependency of the form $C(s)=\exp(s)$. The goal of the optimization is to find the Pareto front, which is a trade-off solution set for Multi-objective problems, at the highest fidelity. 
# 
# In the second part of this tutorial we compare the method with a multi-objective only optimization using qEHVI [2] with q set to 1 (note that MOMF also supports q>1 if the underlying MO acquisition function supports it). The MO-only optimization runs only at the highest fidelity while MOMF makes use of lower fidelity data to estimate the Pareto front at the highest fidelity.

# ### Problem Setup 
# The problem as described before is a modified multi-fidelity version of Branin-Currin (BC) function that results in a 3 x 2 problem. A simple fidelity objective is also defined here which is a linear function of the input fidelity. We also design a wrapper function around the BC that takes care of interfacing torch with numpy and appends the fidelity objective with the BC functions.

# ### Result:  Evaluating the Pareto front at the highest fidelity from MOMF
# 
# After the optimization we are interested in evaluating the final Pareto front. For this we train a GP model with the data acquired by the MOMF optimization. After this we generate $10^4$ random test points between between [0,1] with the fidelity dimension set to 1 to approximate the Pareto front. Two helper functions are defined to achieve this objective where one function generates the test data and the other extracts the Pareto front at the highest fidelity for a given training and testing data.

# # Comparison of MOMF with single-fidelity multi-objective optimization using qEHVI 
# 
# In this section we draw a comparison of the MOMF with qEHVI. For this purpose we will now run 3 trials of the MOMF and qEHVI with 80 iterations for both. For this we define some helper functions for qEHVI similar to what was done for MOMF.

# ### Results
# 
# The following plot shows the hypervolume as a percetage of the true hypervolume for both MOMF and qEHVI. The hypervolume is plotted at each iteration on a log scale. We also plot the confidence intervals derived from running multiple trials for the MOMF and MO.
