    "## Multi-Objective BO with Decoupled Evaluations using HVKG\n",
    "In this tutorial, we illustrate how to use the hypervolume knowledge gradient for problems where the objectives can be evaluated independently (decoupled). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of decoupling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Competitive decoupling**: where the objectives are evaluated using the same evaluation resource. Often the objectives have heterogenous costs and therefore it is prudent to select what design and objective to evaluate in a cost-aware fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-competitive decoupling**: where the objectives have independent evaluation resources and potentially different numbers of designs can be evaluated in parallel. In this scenario, all available evaluation resources should be exploited and the goal is to optimize the objectives as well as possible within a fixed number of time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we focus on competitive decoupling and show how HVKG can be used for efficient optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: `pymoo` is an optional dependency that is used for determining the Pareto set of optimal designs under the model posterior mean using NSGA-II (which is not a sample efficient method, but sample efficiency is not critical for this step). If `pymoo` is not available, the Pareto set of optimal designs is selected from a discrete set. This will work okay for low-dim (e.g. $\\leq2$ dimensions) problems, but in general NSGA-II will yield far better results."
